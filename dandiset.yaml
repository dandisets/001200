description: "In these recordings, we stimulate rats that were injected with AAV virus
  to optogenetically tag for CaMKII or PV to distinguish between excitatory pyramidal
  neurons and inhibitory interneurons in both somatosensory cortex (S1) and posteromedial
  complex (POm) of the thalamus. We alternate between stimulating them optogenetically
  in order to tag the neuronal subtype and testing different PRFs (pulse repetition
  frequencies), pulse durations and pressure levels of ultrasound stimulation using
  a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer to stimulate the somatosensory
  cortex. Electrophysiological recordings were acquired using 32-channel 64-channel
  NeuroNexus electrodes inserted into S1 and 32-channel NeuroNexus electrodes inserted
  into POm. Ultrasound stimulation is delivered every 2.5 seconds with a 10% jitter,
  and each recording has 500 trials. Optogenetic stimulation was delivered at 150mA
  of 50ms. The tFUS parameters (PRFs, PDs and pressure levels) for each recording
  can be found in the identifier field. For example, in BH596_3000_200_67_10_S1_POm,
  \ the PRF is 3000Hz, PD is 200us, pressure level is 10V and stimulation target is
  POm. \n"
